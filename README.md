Group project for the Cognitive Modeling Class Spring 2026 @ RPI

Richard Feynman once said something along the lines of "We don't understand what we can't model." We have modified the wisdom into our own words, but its impact remains—cognitive modeling is crucial to understanding cognition, because we won't understand cognition until we can model it.

Note for HW1: we included in the environment.yml file all the dependencies that was required for everything in the syllabus tech stack, and the in-class and at-home exercises we covered so far. Some packages, if they were not mentioned in the syllabus or exercises, have been automatically installed as dependencies for other packages.
